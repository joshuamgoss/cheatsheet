    <h2>Cheat Sheet Collection</h2>

    <div>
        <a href = "bootstrap.html">Bootstrap</a>
        <a href = "commandline.html">Command Line</a>
        <a href = "git.html">Git</a>

    <p>
        This is the bones of a website meant to house a collection of basic commands, 
        shortcuts, tips, and tricks.  The cheat sheets cover topics used heavily by 
        the Yale Student Development Mentorship Program (SDMP) and more generally by 
        the Yale CCT App-Dev team.

    <p>
        It is a work in progress, freely available to be added to, deleted from, copied,
        or whatever anyone wants to do.  This is NOT the structure that a website SHOULD have.
        A lot of decisions were made in order to keep everything as simple as possible, 
        so things that could - and should - have been used were ommitted.
